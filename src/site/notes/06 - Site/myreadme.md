## 📢 I want to believe and fight for it!

![prova4banner](https://github.com/Eklip5e/Eklip5e/assets/38536104/7dfeb19d-1818-4645-bcf0-145f8e7916a8)

I believe in **FOSS**, in **Recycling** and **Repairability** in terms of **E-Waste**.

Everything has an alternative, you just need to find it.

Everyone should have the freedom to repair and upgrade it's own hardware at home.

Nothing is old enough to toss it in the trash.

Because of that I chose to buy a Framework Laptop and have the freedom of upgrade my main machine with new hardware and sell the old one or re-use it as a Server or a Desktop PC.
